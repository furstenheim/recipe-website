I get nostalgic when fall is around the corner, and I crave for those
delicious comfort dishes I used to get in the school cafeteria. Shepherd’s
Pie! My parents never made Shepherd’s Pie for us when we were growing up.
It was one of those dishes I discovered in my school cafeteria. Reflecting
back on those days in my high school lunchroom, when I was first introduced
to shepherd’s pie. My mom used to pack me sandwiches for school, not
complaining, but I had always wanted a hot lunch instead. Standing in the
line-up I took a peek at what was being served that day, mashed potatoes
and minced meat filling? Who wouldn’t love creamy mashed potatoes and
hearty saucy minced meat filling! I’m in! Now that I’m not in high school
now, it’s rare to find this dish served in restaurants. So I decided to
make it.

I think that shepherd’s pie was designed to use up leftover roasted meat
after a Sunday supper. The leftover meat minced into bits mixed with the
bite-sized veggies, and then smothered with gravy, and topped with leftover
mash. This recipe will not be the repurposing of leftovers, but made with
fresh ingredients that I had in my fridge.

*Did you know?* Cottage Pie, English Meat Pie, Shepherd’s Pie are different
names for a pie or casserole made with minced meat and a crust made from
mashed potatoes.
