Uyghur food is characterized as a hearty, spicy and delicious cuisine that
originates from Xinjiang China. It is a fusion of East Asian techniques.
The cooking style and flavours reflects the many ethnic groups that occupy
Xinjiang region. Xinjiang borders Russia, Mongolia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan,
Tajikistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, and Tibet.

I was introduced to this dish at a small food court stand in Richmond
Public Market. One of my favourite lamb noodle places (Xi’an) happened to
be closed on that day, so we decided to try the Xin Jiang Delicious Food
stand instead. The owner is less fluent in English, but spoke Mandarin to
my partner, and suggested a dish called “Yang Rou Ban Mian”.. From my
horrible Chinese, I figured that it is Lamb “something” Noodles. So I never
knew the correct name until recently. It’s essentially a fried noodle dish
flavoured with vegetables and lamb.

Once upon a yesterday, I decided to try make knife cutting noodles, but was
craving the Xinjiang flavour, so I googled and found Uyghur Laghman. Low
and behold! “Laghman is noodles with vegetables and lamb.” The whole dish
is simple with great flavour. The noodles are boiled until very soft and
then topped with a stir-fried meat and mix of vegetables (bell peppers,
chili peppers, cabbage, onions, and tomatoes) in a meat stock.

### Steps

1. In a bowl, marinade the lamb with 1 teaspoon cumin powder, 1 teaspoon
vegetable oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt, the sugar, the white pepper, and the
cornstarch. Mix well and allow to marinate at room temperature for about 15
minutes.
2. Add water and some salt to a large pot and bring to a boil.
3. Meanwhile, prepare the sauce while boiling the water.
4. Heat 2 teaspoon oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat.
5. Swirl to coat the bottom of the pan with oil.
6. When the oil becomes warm, add lamb. Stir and cook until the surface
turns light brown but the meat is still raw inside, about 2 minutes[](timer:2:minutes).
7. Transfer the lamb to a plate and set aside.
8. Add the remaining 1 teaspoons oil (or less) heat the oil until hot. Add
onions, garlic, and star anise and stir and cook for 1 minute.
9. Add peppers and celery and cook for about a minute.
10. Next add the tomatoes and continue cooking for another minute.
11. Add the remaining salt and cumin powder.
12. Swirl in water. Continue to stir.
13. Add 3/4 of the cilantro. Stir. Keep on low temperature until the
noodles are ready.
14. Cook noodles according to the instructions.
15. Remove the star anise and discard.
16. Add noodles to serving plates and pour the sauce on top. Garnish with
remaining cilantro. Serve immediately.
