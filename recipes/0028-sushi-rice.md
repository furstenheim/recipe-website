1.
      Wash the rice (1 cup = 3 rolls) with running water for 1-2 minutes
      until there is no more starch coming out of it. After you are
done washing,
      take the rice and place it gently in a pot, add a little bit more water
      than rice ( the ratio is about 1.15:1 in favor of the water).
Don’t put too
      much water, or you’ll get dough instead of rice.
2. Cooking the rice. The rice should be cooked on high heat at first, stir every minute or
      two, until the water boils. Then, lower the heat to minimum and cover the
      pot. Stop stirring, the rice will handle itself from now. Why?
That is just
      the Japanese way…
      After 6-8 min, check the water level – If there is no more water,
      only bigger grains of rice in the pot, that means the rice is ready. If
      not, check back every minute, making sure not to burn the rice at the
      bottom.

1. Taking out the rice.   There are a few important issues to keep in mind while taking the rice
   out of the pot. You think I’m kidding right? Well I’m not. First, use only
   a wooden spoon to handle the cooked rice. A metal spoon will damage the
   rice, and can also react with the vinegar we’ll add later. Second, don’t
   scrape the rice out from the bottom of the pot. If it comes out easily,
   good, if not – leave it be. The rice at the bottom is dry and burned so it
   won’t taste so good. Use a wooden or plastic bowl to put the rice in to
   chill.
2.  Seasoning the rice. In order for the rice to taste like sushi rice (and not like ordinary
   rice), you need to add rice vinegar to it right after it is taken out of
   the pot.
1. For 3 cups of (uncooked) rice, use ½ cup of rice vinegar, 2
         tablespoons of sugar and 2 teaspoons of salt. Use only rice
vinegar! Any
         other kind of vinegar will taste bad. -Alternatively, you
could use Sushi
         rice seasoning powder
2. Mix together in a small pot, on medium heat until all solids are
         mixed in.
3. Pour mixture on rice and mix well. That should take a minute or
         two.
4. Let the rice cool down for a few minutes until it reaches room
         temperature. Don’t put the rice in the fridge to make it cool
faster – that
         will damage the rice. You can however use a fan, A/C or put it by the
         window.
5. Important tip – Some people prefer their sushi rice less seasoned.
         Also, there might be differences in strength and flavour
between different
         brands of rice vinegar. If it’s the first time you are making
sushi rice,
         and you are not sure, prepare the amount of seasoning
described above, but
         only use half of it. Mix it with the rice and taste. Trust
your own senses
         if you like to use the full amount or not.
