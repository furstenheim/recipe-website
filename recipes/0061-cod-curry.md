Peel and roughly chop the onions. Warm the oil over a moderate heat in a large frying pan and then add the onions. Grate the ginger, peel and mash the garlic and finely chop the chillies, then mix together to form a paste.

Leave the onions to cook, with the occasional stir, on a low to moderate heat for about 15 minutes[](timer:15:minutes), until they have softened but not coloured. Stir in the paste and continue cooking for a minute or two then add the turmeric.

Now roughly chop the tomatoes, stir in them and their juices, then add the curry leaves. Add Â½ teaspoon of salt, partially cover with a lid and leave to simmer on a low heat for 10 minutes[](timer:10:minutes).

Pour the coconut milk into the simmering sauce, then, as it returns to the bubble, add the cod cheeks and simmer for 7-8 minutes[](timer:8:minutes) until the fish is opaque and will flake easily from the bone.

Ladle into bowls and add the grated lime zest and juice and the chopped mint.
