After making the CHICKEN IN MILK RECIPE BY JAMIE OLIVER
<http://www.sweetrehab.ca/2015/11/07/one-of-the-best-roast-chicken-youll-ever-have/>,
and loving it, I was inspired to make a coconut version. I thought of other
aromatics to include in the ingredients, and it came down to fragrant
kaffir leaves, garlic, and lemongrass. The combination worked really well.
The kaffir leaves and lemongrass brought a vibrant flavour to the coconut
milk. In addition, the fresh and sweet scent permeated throughout home
while it was cooking in the oven.

Kaffir lime leaves are a member of the citrus family. It has a lime-lemon
aroma.

Lemongrass is a tall tropical grass with a clean lemon-like odour.

------------------------------
SO WHAT YOU WILL NEED IS:

1. Preheat the oven to 375Â°F. Season the chicken generously all over with
salt and pepper.
2. In the dutch oven, heat the pan on medium-high heat. Add the grapeseed
oil. Fry the chicken, turning the chicken to get an even colour all over
until golden.
3. Remove from heat. Add the rest of the ingredients into the pot. Place
the pot into the preheated oven for 1 hour and 30 minutes. Baste with the
cooking juice occasionally.
4. To serve, pull the meat off the bones and divide it onto your plates.
Spoon over plenty of sauce and serve with rice or potatoes.
