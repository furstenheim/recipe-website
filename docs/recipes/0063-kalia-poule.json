Add the ground cumin, ground coriander and black pepper, half a tablespoon of salt and 300ml water, and mix well. Stir in the cardamom pods, cloves and cinnamon, then scrape out into a medium bowl. Add the chicken to the bowl, toss to coat and leave to marinate at room temperature for at least 30 minutes[](timer:30:minutes) (or refrigerate and marinate overnight).\n\nMeanwhile, set a large saucepan for which you have a lid on a medium heat, add the oil and, once hot, add the onions, sugar and half a teaspoon of salt, and fry for 15 minutes[](timer:15:minutes), until golden brown. Transfer half the onion mix to a small bowl and set aside.\n\nPut the chicken and its marinade in the pan with the remaining onions, cover the pot and leave to cook for 20 minutes[](timer:20:minutes), stirring once or twice to prevent sticking.\n\nMeanwhile, make the mint yoghurt.

Use a slotted spoon to transfer the cooked potatoes to a large plate lined with kitchen paper, to drain, season with a teaspoon of salt and set aside.\n\nDivide the chicken mixture between four bowls, top with the onions and fried potatoes, finish with a spoonful of mint yoghurt and serve."}
