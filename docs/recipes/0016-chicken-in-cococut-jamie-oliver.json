I thought of other\naromatics to include in the ingredients, and it came down to fragrant\nkaffir leaves, garlic, and lemongrass. The combination worked really well.\nThe kaffir leaves and lemongrass brought a vibrant flavour to the coconut\nmilk. In addition, the fresh and sweet scent permeated throughout home\nwhile it was cooking in the oven.\n\nKaffir lime leaves are a member of the citrus family. It has a lime-lemon\naroma.\n\nLemongrass is a tall tropical grass with a clean lemon-like odour.\n\n------------------------------\nSO WHAT YOU WILL NEED IS:\n\n1. Preheat the oven to 375Â°F. Season the chicken generously all over with\nsalt and pepper.\n2. In the dutch oven, heat the pan on medium-high heat. Add the grapeseed\noil. Fry the chicken, turning the chicken to get an even colour all over\nuntil golden.\n3. Remove from heat. Add the rest of the ingredients into the pot. Place\nthe pot into the preheated oven for 1 hour and 30 minutes. Baste with the\ncooking juice occasionally.\n4. To serve, pull the meat off the bones and divide it onto your plates.\nSpoon over plenty of sauce and serve with rice or potatoes."}
