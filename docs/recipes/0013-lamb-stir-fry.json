It is a fusion of East Asian techniques.\nThe cooking style and flavours reflects the many ethnic groups that occupy\nXinjiang region. Xinjiang borders Russia, Mongolia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan,\nTajikistan, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, and Tibet.\n\nI was introduced to this dish at a small food court stand in Richmond\nPublic Market. One of my favourite lamb noodle places (Xi’an) happened to\nbe closed on that day, so we decided to try the Xin Jiang Delicious Food\nstand instead. The owner is less fluent in English, but spoke Mandarin to\nmy partner, and suggested a dish called “Yang Rou Ban Mian”.. From my\nhorrible Chinese, I figured that it is Lamb “something” Noodles. So I never\nknew the correct name until recently. It’s essentially a fried noodle dish\nflavoured with vegetables and lamb.\n\nOnce upon a yesterday, I decided to try make knife cutting noodles, but was\ncraving the Xinjiang flavour, so I googled and found Uyghur Laghman. Low\nand behold! “Laghman is noodles with vegetables and lamb.” The whole dish\nis simple with great flavour. The noodles are boiled until very soft and\nthen topped with a stir-fried meat and mix of vegetables (bell peppers,\nchili peppers, cabbage, onions, and tomatoes) in a meat stock.\n\n### Steps\n\n1. In a bowl, marinade the lamb with 1 teaspoon cumin powder, 1 teaspoon\nvegetable oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt, the sugar, the white pepper, and the\ncornstarch. Mix well and allow to marinate at room temperature for about 15\nminutes.\n2. Add water and some salt to a large pot and bring to a boil.\n3. Meanwhile, prepare the sauce while boiling the water.\n4. Heat 2 teaspoon oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat.\n5. Swirl to coat the bottom of the pan with oil.\n6. When the oil becomes warm, add lamb. Stir and cook until the surface\nturns light brown but the meat is still raw inside, about 2 minutes[](timer:2:minutes).\n7. Transfer the lamb to a plate and set aside.\n8. Add the remaining 1 teaspoons oil (or less) heat the oil until hot. Add\nonions, garlic, and star anise and stir and cook for 1 minute.\n9. Add peppers and celery and cook for about a minute.\n10. Next add the tomatoes and continue cooking for another minute.\n11. Add the remaining salt and cumin powder.\n12. Swirl in water. Continue to stir.\n13. Add 3/4 of the cilantro. Stir. Keep on low temperature until the\nnoodles are ready.\n14. Cook noodles according to the instructions.\n15. Remove the star anise and discard.\n16. Add noodles to serving plates and pour the sauce on top. Garnish with\nremaining cilantro. Serve immediately."}
